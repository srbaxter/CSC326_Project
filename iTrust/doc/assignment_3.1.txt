+ Any major design decisions you made; interpretations of the assignment that you think the TA should know about
    Servlets were a big deal
    
+ The tests you added (doesn't need to be detailed, just the package and a few classes would suffice)
    GroupReportActionTest, XmlGeneratorTest

	Servlets are in the awkward place between GUI and Controllers, and are very difficult to test with JUnit as you
	cannot inject anything except for the HTTPRequest and HTTPServlet. Because of this, any DAO methods will fail unless
	they are superficial servlets. Our servlet has a below 80% code coverage rate, but all of the references they have
	to the XmlGenerator and GroupReportAction are well above the 80% threshhold.
