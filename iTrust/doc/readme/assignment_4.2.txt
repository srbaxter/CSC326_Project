+ Anything that you did not finish
    I believe that I added everything that asked for in this version of iTrust. I may have missed something in the assignment,
    but for the most part, I believe that I added everything.
    
+ Any major design decisions you made; interpretations of the assignment that you think the TA should know about
  The major design decision was my interpretation of how UAPs would view the insurance claims that were made. My interpretation
  of this allows all UAPs to view all insurance claims.
    
+ The tests you added (doesn't need to be detailed, just the package and a few classes would suffice)
    unittest: 
    	-action:EditOfficeVisitActionTest, action:ViewMyBillingActionTest, action:PayBillActionTest
    	-edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.action : ViewClaimsActionTest.java
    								  VerifyClaimsActionTest.java
    httptest: InsuranceNotificationTest.java, InsuranceSubmissionTest.java

+ Anything else you think the TA should know about before grading
	There were quite a few things that were missing in the version of iTrust that I began with (ie time and date tracking of bills).
	This is the reason why there are so many changed files.
