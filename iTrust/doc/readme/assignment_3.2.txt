+ Anything that you did not finish
    hashing credit card numbers
    
+ Any major design decisions you made; interpretations of the assignment that you think the TA should know about
   We stuck with the requirements as assigned, adding a page to view bills and another page to pay bills
   for the patient. Payment amounts are typed in a text box by the HCP. Default is $100.
    
+ The tests you added (doesn't need to be detailed, just the package and a few classes would suffice)
    unittest: 
    	-action:EditOfficeVisitActionTest, action:ViewMyBillingActionTest, action:PayBillActionTest
    	-edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.dao.billing 
    	-bean:BillingBeanLoaderTest
    	-dao:UpdateOfficeVisitTest
    httptest: DocumentOfficeVisitTest, OfficeVisitBillingTest, NotificationAreaTest

+ Anything else you think the TA should know about before grading
	The following tests pass in Eclipse but fail in Jenkins:
		edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.OfficeVisitBillingTest.testCancelPayment
 		edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.OfficeVisitBillingTest.testCreditCard	
 		edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.OfficeVisitBillingTest.testInsurance	
 		edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.OfficeVisitBillingTest.testPaymentLogging	
 		edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.OfficeVisitBillingTest.testViewBilling	
 		edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.OfficeVisitBillingTest.testIncorrectData	
 		edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.OfficeVisitBillingTest.testBadPolicyID
 		
 	They all get "Error on HTTP request: 500 Internal Error". Working with the TAs, we were unable to
 	figure out why this was happening.
